Eons ago, there were several dragons.
These dragons then ate all the peeps.
Faries then ate all the peeps.

"Oh no cried everyone, what are we supposed to do?"

"RAWR" said the dragon, "So long as I am not tickled, these people should digest nicely."
Bard had different plans, he was going to 'tickle' the dragon...
