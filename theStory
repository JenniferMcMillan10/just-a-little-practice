Eons ago, there were several dragons.
These dragons then ate all the peeps.
Faeries then ate all the peeps.

"Oh no cried everyone, what are we supposed to do?", The crowd worried, For they were all very scared.

"RAWR" said the dragon, "So long as I am not tickled, these people should digest nicely."
Bard had different plans, he was going to 'tickle' the dragon...
